Combined credit cards offer interest-free deals on balance transfers _and_ new purchases. Use one correctly and, for a period, you don't need to pay interest on any of your credit card debts or spending. Saving you _hundreds of pounds_ every year.

What is a Combined Credit Card?
-------------------------------

A [balance transfer and purchase credit card](https://www.totallymoney.com/credit-cards/0-percent/) is effectively two cards in one. It offers you all the perks of a [balance transfer credit card](https://www.totallymoney.com/credit-cards/balance-transfer/), i.e. a lengthy interest free period on existing credit card debts, _and_ the benefits of a [0% purchase card](https://www.totallymoney.com/credit-cards/purchase/) \- no interest to pay on new spending. They're ideal for anyone wanting to stop paying interest on existing debts _and _ for those who enjoy some interest-free new spending. However, the interest-free periods on combined credit cards are shorter than if you get separate[balance transfer](https://www.totallymoney.com/credit-cards/balance-transfer/) and [purchase cards](https://www.totallymoney.com/credit-cards/purchase/), so if you want a longer time of 0% interest go for a specialist [balance transfer card](https://www.totallymoney.com/credit-cards/balance-transfer/)or [purchase card](https://www.totallymoney.com/credit-cards/purchase/)instead.

Is this the Card for Me?
------------------------

### Get a combined credit card if:

*   You want one card for all your credit card needs. A combined balance transfer and spending card eliminates the need to monitor multiple credit card accounts and till-point panics about which card you should be using.
*   You are worried about making multiple credit card applications and need a balance transfer and 0% spending card. Applying for a combined credit card will halve the number of applications you need to make. You can also improve your chances of being approved first time by using [**our advanced credit matching technology**.](https://www.totallymoney.com/credit-cards/find-eligibility/)

### Don’t get a combined credit card if:

*   You are looking for a cheap way to clear your debt. You will get a much longer 0% period if you opt for a credit card that only offers a [balance transfer deal](https://www.totallymoney.com/credit-cards/balance-transfer/). There also tends to be a lower balance transfer fee on the latter too, making them the cheapest way to clear your credit card debt. Find out more with our [guide to balance transfer cards](https://www.totallymoney.com/credit-cards/balance-transfer-credit-card/).
*   You don’t have any existing credit card debt. If you are only looking for a cheap card for new spending you will be better off with a [0% purchase card](https://www.totallymoney.com/credit-cards/purchase/), as the interest-free period is likely to be longer. You can learn more with our [guide to purchase cards](https://www.totallymoney.com/credit-cards/0-purchase-credit-card/).
*   You clear your balance in full each month. If you won’t be building up any new debt you will be better off with a credit card that rewards your good spending habits, such as a [cashback](https://www.totallymoney.com/credit-cards/cashback/) or [rewards card](https://www.totallymoney.com/credit-cards/rewards/). Go to our guide to [rewards cards](https://www.totallymoney.com/credit-cards/rewards-credit-card/) or [cashback cards](https://www.totallymoney.com/credit-cards/cashback-credit-cards/) to find out more.

How to Make the Most of a Combined Credit Card
----------------------------------------------

### Never Miss a Payment

Set up a direct debit to cover at least the minimum payment on your card. If you miss a payment it will have a negative effect on your credit rating and can also result in your credit card provider pulling your [0% interest deal](https://www.totallymoney.com/credit-cards/purchase/). A direct debit will stop this from happening.

### Clear your Debt in Time

If you still have debt on a combined card after the 0% period ends the interest charges will quickly wipe out the benefit of using the card in the first place. So, make sure you have cleared the debt before the 0% period runs out, or if you can’t do that move the debt to another 0% deal.

### Remember the End Date

A combined credit card is only worth using during the 0% period. After that the interest rate shoots up and you’ll start paying a fortune for your debt. So set up a reminder or make a note in your diary of when the 0% period ends and make sure to apply for a new credit card before you start paying interest. \[cards-promo\]
