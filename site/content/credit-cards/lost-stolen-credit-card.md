Minimise the pain of a stolen or lost credit card by following our guide on who you need to inform, what you need to do, and how to make sure you don't end up footing the bill for fraudsters. We'll also run you through what you need to do if you lose your entire bag and the insurance you should consider getting to protect yourself in future.

How to Report the Loss
----------------------

### Call your provider

As soon as you know that your card has been lost or stolen you must call your credit card provider. The sooner you call the better because until you've informed them the card is gone, you could be liable for any losses. Once your card provider knows the card is no longer in your possession your legal status changes, meaning that you should be refunded in full for any future transactions that take place. The majority of companies have 24-hour telephone lines for such emergencies. You can find the number for your card provider [here](#8).

### Follow up in writing

Since the date and time that you reported the loss of theft of your card is important when claiming back for any unauthorised expenditure, it’s best to follow up this telephone call in writing. In either a letter or an e-mail you should include your account number, the date, time and place that you first noticed your card was missing and when you first reported it was missing. On top of this, keep records of any further transactions for future reference.

Protect Yourself from Fraud
---------------------------

You should always [check your credit card](https://www.totallymoney.com/credit-cards/) statement for mistakes, but be particularly vigilent after losing your credit card or having it stolen. Report any transactions you don't recall making to your credit card provider immediately along with any information (eg. if you were in a different country at the time of the purchase) that proves you couldn't have made the transaction. You will also have to fill in forms detailing any transactions on your account that were not made by you. Also keep a [close eye on your credit report](https://www.totallymoney.com/free-credit-report/) for any signs someone is using your identity fraudulently with details obtained from your credit card. You can find out more about your credit report and how to check it with our guide to [improving your credit rating](https://www.totallymoney.com/free-credit-report/improve-your-credit-rating/).

Your Right to Get Your Money Back
---------------------------------

So long as you haven't been negligent you are only liable for the first £50 of unauthorised withdrawals or transactions on your card after it is lost or stolen. But, if your card provider can prove you were negligent you could be landed with a much bigger bill. What counts as negligent? There is no precise definition but these points give you the general idea:

*   Storing your pin number with your card. Eg. Having it written on your card or on a piece of paper in your wallet.
*   Telling anyone your pin.
*   Changing your pin to something ridiculously easy to guess. Eg. 1111 or 1234.

However, if your provider thinks that you have been grossly negligent or fraudulent then it’s up to them to prove it.

Is Your Bank Refusing to Pay?
-----------------------------

If your card provider suspects foul play or negligence and refuses to pay out, you should ask for your dispute to be escalated through the internal complaints process of the card provider. However, if that doesn't work you should take your dispute to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS). **REMEMBER –** They must prove that you have been fraudulent or negligent. The decision of the FOS is binding upon your provider but not you. If you still dispute their decision and think you still have a strong case you can take your claim to court.

What Else Was Stolen?
---------------------

The chances are you haven't just lost your credit card. Here are some tips on what to do about other things you may have lost:

*   **Debit cards** \- You need to act fast and in the same way as for your credit card. Call your provider and report your card lost or stolen, then follow this up in writing. As with credit cards, until you've reported your debit card lost you are liable for any transactions made on it.
*   **Driver’s licence** - You need one to drive so get on and order a new one quickly. It costs £20 to get a new one and you'll need to provide proof of ID and three years of address details. You can order a new licence [here](https://www.gov.uk/renew-driving-licence).
*   **Reward/Membership Cards** - Contact the relevant company to request a new card. If it is a card that builds up loyalty points, make sure your old balance is carried over.
*   **Keys** - If you've got a spare set you may be inclined to just use those, but if there is any chance your address was printed on anything that was lost at the same time as your keys (for example, your driving licence) you need to get your locks changed. Otherwise, thieves could just let themselves in to your home.
*   **Passport** - As soon as your passport is lost or stolen it needs to be reported to the Identity and Passport Service (IPS) and (if in the UK) your nearest police station. To get a new passport you then need to follow the standard passport renewal process, plus you'll have to send a completed [LS01 form](http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/@travel/documents/digitalasset/dg_175799.pdf) with your application (if you haven’t already reported it as stolen).
