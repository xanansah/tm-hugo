Why is it important to have a good credit score?
------------------------------------------------

There are several reasons why it’s important to have a good credit score. If you’re hoping, for example, to take out a [mortgage to buy your own home](https://www.totallymoney.com/mortgages/) one day, your credit score will need to be in good shape to get accepted and to get the best rates. Having a good credit score also means you’re much more likely to get the best rates when you take out other credit products. For example, you’re much more likely to get better credit card offers (such as longer balance transfers and purchase deals), low-APR loans, and even 0% finance agreements if your credit score is good. If your credit score isn’t good, though, it doesn’t necessarily mean you won’t get accepted for credit. However, lenders will view you as more of a risk, and as a result your interest rates will probably be higher, and any purchase or balance transfer offers you get will probably be shorter. Before you apply for anything, it’s always a good idea to check your eligibility and see your chances of being accepted.
