There are four main things you should check on your credit report, so here’s a poem about what they are. Why? For fun, and to help you remember.

The Credit Report Check
=======================

* * *

Once upon a midnight dreary, you did ponder, weak and weary, Over many an email about your poor score. And so you checked it, quickly explored, and saw more accounts than you could recall — Could this be a sign of credit fraud? Fraud attacking your credit score. Something you didn’t know because you never checked before — So check it now, check it for your credit score. Ah, there were some other messes, something about your linked addresses, Some that said you were living next door. Blast! It must be where the lender was wrong, because you were living here all along Trying to make your credit rating strong — strong to make your Borrowing Power soar. Something you didn’t know because you never checked before — So check it now, check it for your credit score. And something else to fill you with curses: unrecognised hard credit searches, Simply something you can’t ignore. For someone’s applying for credit in your name, playing the system for a game, Enough to make you loudly exclaim — exclaim, “Not my beloved credit score!” Something you didn’t know because you never checked before — So check it now, check it for your credit score. But one thing to ensure your score prevails: get on top of your personal details — Something that we all implore. ’Cause it helps to know where you live on earth, as well as your date of birth, To get on the Electoral Register for even more worth — worth to boost your credit score. Something you didn’t know because you never checked before — So check it now, check it for your credit score.
