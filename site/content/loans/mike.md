If you’re thinking of applying for credit, the APR - or interest rate — is probably one of the first things you'll look at. Interest is the price of credit. So it makes sense to look for a product with the lowest APR possible.

But why is the advertised APR usually called “representative” or “typical”? How is this different from the real (‘guaranteed’) APR? And, more importantly, does this mean the real APR will be higher than the advertised rate?
